== Introduction

This Developer Guide is written by the SaveIt team for the benefits of future developers and maintainers of the application.

* *Setup*: The steps you need in order to set up your development environment for the application, as well as any prerequisites required by your system.
* *Design*: Information on the underlying structure of the code, and how the logic of each model / component interact with each other through Unified Model Diagrams (UMLs).
* *Implementation*: Contains a detailed explanation on how our core features implemented, and any considerations made behind the implementation.
* *Documentation*: A general guide of the documentation process of the application.
* *Testing*: Documentation for the coverage tests of the application and how to set up your testing environment.
* *Dev Ops*: The general processes used during development phase, and documentation on how to set it up.

**SaveIt** is an open-source project, should any developers be interested, see Contact Us page for more information.

== Setting up

This section provides the prerequisites and steps to set up development environment. The way to verify the set up and essential configurations are also included.

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.saveit.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

This section provides suggested configurations to check before start coding, including coding style set up, documentation update, as well as Continuous Integration set up.

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify:

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.* `, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `CS2103-AY1819S1-T12-4/main` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `CS2103-AY1819S1-T12-4/main`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

This section provides the overview of this application, including the design of architecture, UI, logic, model, storage and common classes.
Diagrams are also provided for the better understanding.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for:

* At app launch: Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shutting down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level:

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by other classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components:

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: The model holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: The storage reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

Events-Driven nature of the design.

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeleteIssue.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how `Model` simply raises a `SaveItChangedEvent` when the SaveIt data is changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeleteIssueEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

The figure above shows the breakdown of the smaller components involved in the `UI` Component. The `UI` Component is the interface (abstraction barrier) between the user and the underlying components - `Model` and `Logic`.

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

// tag::logiccomponent[]

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `Logic` Component can be split into two subcomponents:

*1. Command Logic Subcomponent*

The command logic subcomponent encapsulates the execution of all commands. Each command is represented its own class (e.g. `FindCommand.java`, `AddCommand.java`) which all inherit from an abstract `Command.java` class.

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]


.  `Logic` uses the `SaveItParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a statement) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

*2. Suggestion Logic Subcomponent*

The suggestion logic subcomponent encapsulates the evaluation of user inputs as it is keyed into the command line, differing from the command logic in that command logic is only executed upon entering the command, whereas suggestion logic is called whenever the user input changes (without the need to enter).

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/logic/SuggestionLogic.java[`SuggestionLogic.java`]


. `SuggestionLogic` parses user inputs whenever it changes.
. This determines which `Suggestion` object is created by the `SuggestionLogicManager`.
. The evaluation of the `Suggestion` object reads data from the `Model` (e.g. finds a specific `Issue`).
. The result of the evaluation is encapsulated as a `SuggestionResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.


Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component when an API call is made. The Sequence Diagram is split into two branches of logic:

. *Command logic:* Shows an example command execution of the `delete 1` Command, which calls the `DeleteCommand`.
. *Suggestion logic:* Shows an example suggestion evaluation of the user input `edit 1 i/`, which calls the `CopyExistingSuggestion`.

.Example Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the command and suggestion logic subcomponents.
image::SDexamplesForLogic.png[width="800"]

// end::logiccomponent[]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelComponentClassDiagram.png[width="900"]

The `Model` Component contains the classes which are representations of the data stored by the application, and how each data objects are linked with each other.

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the SaveIt data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Issue>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
====
* As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `SaveIt`, which `Issue` can reference. This will allow `SaveIt` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Issue` needing their own `Tag` object.

* The current model implements a `currentDirectory` to difference edition of issue and edition of solution with the same edit command. Besides, `AddCommand`, `ClearCommand` may also work differently for issues and solutions.
====

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

The `Storage` Component is the interface that involves reading and storing the data objects in XML files, which allows data to persist across multiple sessions.

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the SaveIt data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.saveit.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented. Note that this section does not fully encompass all the features, but the more core features of the application.

// tag::add[]
=== Add feature
The add command can add both issue and solution to SaveIt. It includes two levels:

* Root level
** Issue statement
** Issue description
** Issue tags
* Issue level
** Solution link
** Solution remark

==== Add issue
Adding a new issue can only happen at the root level

===== Current implementation
The `SaveItParser` is used to call `AddCommandParser` so as to pass the entered issue. In order to build a new `Issue` object, a dummy solution link and dummy solution remark will be used. After that, `AddCommand` is invoked which will ask model to add the issue to the `Model` component.
In order to store the new issue inside the SaveIt, `VersionedSaveIt` will be invoked and it will add issue to the `UniqueIssueList`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the add new issue feature functions:

.Add Issue Command Sequence Diagram
image::AddNewIssue.png[width="800"]

This diagram gives a clear procedure that how the user input is passed step by step by calling different methods and objects in different sequences.

==== Add solution to existing issue
Adding a new solution can only happen at the issue level

===== Current implementation
The `SaveItParser` is used to call `AddCommandParser` just like how adding issue feature functions as above mentioned. However, this time, the new solution link and solution remark is provided to `AddCommand` instead. In order to build a new `Issue` object, dummy issue statement and dummy issue description will be used. During execution, `addSolution` method, which was newly added, in Model component will be invoked to add the solution. The detailed implementation of `addSolution` in model component is quite simple. Since the list stored in application is immutable, each time, a new issue will be created with original statement and description, then the new solution will be added to that particular issue. Finally, `updateIssue` method will be called to replace the issue in `versionedSaveIt`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the add solution feature functions

.Add Solution Command Sequence Diagram
image::AddNewSolution.png[width="800"]

This diagram shows the sequence that how add solution command is executed. It could be also noticed that it is basically similar to that of add new issue feature besides it invokes updateIssue method in Model component rather than addIssue method.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How add solutions executes
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Combine AddIssue and AddSolution together and distinguish them at the stage of `AddCommandParser`
** Pros: Consistent syntax between the two features, so the command is more user-friendly.
** Cons: Need to put more effort on distinguishing the difference between these two requests, `AddCommandParser` is relatively complex compared to the other parser component.
* **Alternative 2:** Build a new command especially for adding solution
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: The command set becomes too complex for the user.

===== Aspect: How add command distinguishes between adding solution and adding issue
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Pass a newly created issue with dummy issue statement or dummy solution link
** Pros: Consistent coding style and less change on logic structure
** Cons: Quite complex implementation compared to other command
* **Alternative 2:** Overload Issue constructor so that different issues will be passed to `AddCommand` accordingly.
* Pros: Relatively easier to implement
* Cons: Lots of changes on structure.
// end::add[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sort feature

The sort command can sort an issue list shown in the GUI.

==== Current implementation

We use JavaFX `SortedList` and the Comparator provided by `SortType` to sort the list.

In order to allow sorting to work with the filtered list, we wrap `FilteredList` with `SortedList` and retrieve this new list with a new method `getFilteredAndSortedList()`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the mechanism works:

.Sort Command Sequence Diagram
image::SortCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

This diagram shows that after the input is parsed, a SortType object is initialized before the SortCommand object.

As shown in the diagram, a SortType object can provide the required comparator and we use the retrieved Comparator to sort the list when the sort command is executed.

The following is a class diagram for SortType.

.SortType Class Diagram
image::SortType.png[width="500"]

It shows that Comparator is an attribute of SortType class. We create three different classes that implement the Comparator Interface.
They can serve the three sort types (excluding the default one) we provide in SaveIt. When more sort types are needed, we can simply create another class implementing Comparator, and add another case in the switch statement.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How sort executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Combine SortedList and FilteredList, sort at GUI side

** Pros: Consistent sorting. Doesn't affect the memory of issue lists.

** Cons: Need efforts to make sure the correct list is retrieved.

* **Alternative 2:** Reconstruct UniqueIssueList directly, sort in Storage

** Pros: Easy to understand and implement.

** Cons: Break the persistence of the backend list.
// end::sort[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedSaveIt`.
It extends `saveit` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `saveItStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedSaveIt#commit()` -- Saves the current SaveIt state in its history.
* `VersionedSaveIt#undo()` -- Restores the previous SaveIt state from its history.
* `VersionedSaveIt#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone SaveIt state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitSaveIt()`, `Model#undoSaveIt()` and `Model#redoSaveIt()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedSaveIt` will be initialized with the initial SaveIt state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single SaveIt state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th statement in the SaveIt. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitSaveIt()`, causing the modified state of the SaveIt after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `saveItStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted SaveIt state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add i/Array...` to add a new issue. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitSaveIt()`, causing another modified SaveIt state to be saved into the `saveItStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]
[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitSaveIt()`, so the SaveIt state will not be saved into the `saveItStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the issue was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoSaveIt()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous SaveIt state, and restores the SaveIt to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial SaveIt state, then there are no previous SaveIt states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoSaveIt()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

.The above sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoSaveIt()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the SaveIt to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `saveItStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest SaveIt state, then there are no undone SaveIt states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoSaveIt()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the SaveIt, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitSaveIt()`, `Model#undoSaveIt()` or `Model#redoSaveIt()`. Thus, the `saveItStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]
Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitSaveIt()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `saveItStateList`, all SaveIt states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add i/Array ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

.The above activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Save the entire SaveIt.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Implement redo/undo individually for each of the commands.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the statement being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of SaveIt states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedSaveIt`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::confirmation[]
=== Confirmation Check

Some commands that can affect the users' experience significantly need to be paid attention to and confirmation should be provided before they are executed.
For the current version, `clear` is the only command that needs confirmation.

==== Current Implementation

.Clear Command Activity Diagram
image::ClearCommand.png[width="800"]

As shown in the diagram, instead of letting Logic execute the command directly after parsing it, we now check if we need confirmation before the command is executed.

In order to connect the confirmation with the command: +

Step 1. We buffer the command that requires confirmation. +

Step 2. Wait for the user to input confirmation message. +

Step 3. Clear the buffer. +

Step 4. Generate the CommandResult according to the confirmation message entered.


==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: How to distinguish commands that need confirmation

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use abstract class DangerCommand

** Pros: Protect the specific Command type from being accessed by LogicManager. Sustainable.

** Cons: N.A.

* **Alternative 2:** Check class name and provide a danger class name list

** Pros: Easy to implement.

** Cons: Command information leaked. Inaccurate, e.g. two classes from different packages can have the same class name.

===== Aspect: How to connect the confirmation message with the command requiring it

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Buffer the command

** Pros: Protect CommandBox from being accessed by Command, i.e. retrieve the input message in Command Class

** Cons: Another variable introduced. Need efforts to deal with the buffered command properly.

* **Alternative 2:** Let Command check the confirmation message

** Pros: Follow the normal logic. Easy to understand.

** Cons: CommandBox is exposed to Command Class.
// end::confirmation[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== Directory Level Model

SaveIt manages a list of issues, with each issue containing a list of solutions.
 To manage the data with two-level structure, SaveIt implemented a directory model
  in the Model component and UI component.

==== Current Implementation
Currently a directory class is maintained in `SaveIt`. It consist of `root` level and `issue` level.
 The solution level is disabled for now as the complexity of current version of SaveIt
  does not require the three-level directory system.

===== Command Execution

Before any command is executed,
 it will query the current directory and determine the command result.
  Some commands will have different command word and command result at different directory, such as:
  `edit`, `add`. Some commands can only be executed at root level
  , such as `sort`, `addtag`, `refactortag`, `find`, `findtag`.

===== Home Command

To traverse between `root` and `issue` level, a new command `home` is added to the command list.
`home` Command changes the current directory to `root` level and post `DirectoryChangedEvent`,
 which invokes the UI to load the issue list in the list panel. It is shown in the sequence
 diagram below

.Home Command Sequence Diagram
image::HomeCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Consideration
===== Aspect: How to manage the issues and solutions with two-level structure

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement a directory level model explicitly.

** Pros: The data structure is clearer. Target users are familiar
 with director level system, such as file system in Linux.

** Cons: Changing directory may be inconvenient for users.

* **Alternative 2:** Manage the issue-solution structure by specifying index in commands.

** Pros: No need to change the previous structure.
** Cons:The structure is not clear and the users may be confused.

=== UI Enhancement
The figures below show the current UI for SaveIt v1.4.

.SaveIt UI Displaying Issue List
image::UI.png[width="790"]

.SaveIt UI Displaying Solution List
image::UI2.png[width="790"]

In the above figures, the left column is the list panel which displays the list of issues or
the list of solutions. The browser panel at bottom right displays the web page of the url as in the solution link.
When no page is loaded, it displays the default page as above. Whenever a solution is selected,
the browser panel loads the url given in the solution link as below.

.Browser Panel loading Web-Page
image::after selecting solution.png[width="790"]

==== Current Implementation
Currently the list panel implements a two-level structure. When the directory is at root level, it displays
a list of issues. When the directory is at issue level, it displays the solution list of the selected issue.
The list panel interacts with other components through `DirectoryChangedEvent` and `JumpToListRequestEvent`.
The sequence diagram is as shown below.

.Change From Solution List to Issue List
image::UI_Sequence_Diagram_1.png[width="790"]

.Change from Issue List to Solution List
image::UI_Sequence_Diagram_2.png[width="790"]

==== Design Consideration
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use one panel and switch between the two list.
** Pros: The panel takes less space. It also represents the directory structure model in UI.
** Cons: Need to switch between lists. Cannot display the issues while displaying the solutions.

* **Alternative 2:** Use two panels to display the issue list and solution list.
** Pros: Both lists can be viewed at the same time. Implementation is easier.
** Cons: It takes too much space in the UI.

// tag::edit[]
=== Edit Feature
The edit feature allows users to edit any field of the issue and solution.

==== Current Implementation
The edit mechanism is facilitated by `editCommandParser` and `editCommand`. Users are allowed to edit any field in the issue list.

The `editCommandParser` extends `Parser` and implements the following operations:

* `editCommandParser#parser(String args)`
** Checks the arguments for empty strings and throws a `ParseException` if empty string is found.
** Analyses the argument to check if it is a valid command format. If it is a valid format, it will set the corresponding filed using `EditDescriptor`. There are two types format.
*** edit issue: edit Index i/statement d/description t/tag1 t/tag2 ...
*** edit solution: `edit Index s/https://www.dummysolutionlink.com r/remark`.

If it fails to parse the command, it will throw `ParseException` and display edit command usage message.

* `editCommand#execute(Model model, CommandHistory history)`
** Analyses the user in the home directory or issue directory. Since the home directory can only edit issues, if user provides solution related command, it will fail to execute. Also, in the issue directory, it only allows to edit solution, it will fail to execute the issue related command. Then it will
throw `CommandException` and show wrong directory information.

** Checks if the user index in editDescriptor is larger than the size of the issue list or solution list. +
Throw `CommandException` and show invalid index warning. Otherwise, call the function `model.updateIssue(issueToEdit, editedIssue)` to update issue list.

Please refer to the Sequence Diagram below for the illustration of edit operation.

.Edit Command Sequence Diagram
image::edit-command-sequence-diagram.jpg[width="800"]

==== Design Consideration
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Update the whole issue fields when every single field needs to edit.

** Pros: It is easy to implement in current implementation.

** Cons: It may have performance issues regarding memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Update the specific data field instead of updating the whole issue.

** Pros: It will use less memory.

** Cons: It has lower security if the issue is the mutable object.
// end::edit[]

// tag::retrieve[]
=== Retrieve Feature
The retrieve feature allows user to choose a solution link and copy it to the system clipboard.

==== Current Implementation

The retrieve feature basically takes the user entered index and call `getFilteredAndSortedList` method in `Model` to get the selected solution. Then Java `Toolkit` package is used to copy the url link of solution to the system clipboard.
// end::retrieve[]


// tag::setprimary[]
=== Set Primary Feature
The set primary feature allows users to choose one solution as primary.

==== Current Implementation

The set primary solution mechanism is facilitated by the method `isPrimarySolution()`, which is overrode by `PrimarySolution` inheriting from `Solution`.

==== Design Consideration
===== Aspect: How to distinguish between PrimarySolution and Solution
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use PrimarySolution as a subclass of Solution

** Pros: No flag attribute is introduced. More sustainable.

** Cons: New object is created. May affect performance.

* **Alternative 2:** Add a flag attribute to Solution

** Pros: Easy to understand and implement.

** Cons: Solution constructor is affected. The flag attribute is redundant for non-primary solutions.

* **Alternative 3:** Store the primary solution index in the solution list.

** Pros: No new constructor and attribute are introduced.

** Cons: Need to check if the index is affected every time when the solution list is updated.
// end::setprimary[]

// tag::resetprimary[]
=== Reset Primary Feature
The reset primary feature allows users to reset the primary solution and make all solutions normal and not highlighted.

==== Current Implementation

The reset primary solution mechanism goes through the solution list once and checks if a solution is primary or not.
If it is primary, we replace it with a new Solution object with the same data of the primary solution. If it is not primary, we continue checking until we reach the end of the list.
// end::resetprimary[]

// tag::refactortag[]
=== Refactor Tag Feature
The refactor tag feature allows users to rename or remove a specified tag for all entries with that tag.

==== Current Implementation
The refactor tag mechanism is facilitated by `RefactorTagCommandParser` and `RefactorCommand`.

The `RefactorTagCommandParser` extends `Parser` and implements the following operations:

* `refactorTagCommandParser#parser(String args)`
** Checks the arguments for empty strings and throws a `ParseException` if an empty string is found.
** Analyses the argument to check if it is a valid command format. Users are not allowed to provide other prefixes, except `t/` and `n/` in refactor tag command.
*** `t/` the tag that user wants to refactor, which must be input by users, otherwise throws `ParserException` and shows refactor tag command usage message.
*** `n/` the new tag that the user wants to replace the original one with, which is optional. (if the user does not provide, then remove the original one)

If it fails to parse the command, it will throw `ParseException` and display refactor tag command usage message.

* `refactorTagCommand#execute(Model model, CommandHisotry history)`
** updates the issue list and returns success message if it has edited an issue, otherwise shows an unsuccessful message.
** Iterates all the issues in the saveIt, if it contains the old tag, it will replace with the new tag if provided. Then update the list.

Please refer to the Sequence Diagram below for the refactor tag operation.

.Refactor Tag Activity Diagram
image::refactor-tag-activity-diagram.png[width="400"]

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Implementation of RefactorTag command parser.
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allows only to rename or remove the old tags that user input lastly.
** Pros: It is easy to implement.
** Cons: It is inconvenient if the user wants to replace multiple tags once.
* Alternative 2: Allows to rename or remove multiple old tags with multiple new tags.
** Pros: It is convenient for users to replace or remove the tags once.
** Cons: It is not clear for users to see the changes since tags are displayed disordered.
// end::refactortag[]



// tag::addtag[]
=== Add tag Feature
The add tag feature allows users to add `Tag(s)` to specified `Indexed` issues.

==== Current Implementation
The add tag mechanism is facilitated by `AddTagCommandParser` and `AddTagCommand`.

Please refer to the Sequence Diagram below for the illustration of add tag operation.

.Add Tag Command Sequence Diagram
image::add-tag-sequence-diagram.jpeg[width="600"]

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Implementation of AddTag command parser.
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allows a range of index and multiple indexes to be accepted as index parameter.
** Pros: It is efficient to add multiple `Tags` to multiple issues instead of doing it singly.
** Cons: It has to consider various conditions of the user input.
* Alternative 2: Creates an `IndexRange` class for index.
** Pros: It is easy to understand and maintain.
** Cons: It increases coupling between `IndexRange` class and `Index` class
// end::addtag[]

// tag::suggestion[]
=== Suggestion Feature
The suggestion feature allows user to quickly complete commands by showing a drop-down window of suggested values when the user input matches a specific keyword or identifier.

==== Current Implementation

The figure below shows a basic relationship between each class.
The `SuggestionLogicManager` implements `SuggestionLogic` interface and overrides the `evaluate` method. Similarly, `IssueNameSuggestion`, `TagNameSuggestion` and `CopyExistingSuggestion` implement `Suggestion` interface and override `evaluate` method.

.SuggestionLogic Class Diagram
image::SuggestionClassUML.png[width="400"]
// end::suggestion[]

Since the suggestion component has to retrieve the data from model component to give a suggestion according to the user's input, it is considered as a part of `Logic` component. By listening to changes in the text field, which is handled in `CommandBox`, the `SuggestionLogicManager` will be able to decide which type of suggestion should be given by parsing the following fields:

. The command typed
. The prefixes from `ArgumentTokenizer`
. The caret position (position of the text cursor in the user input string)

For example, when entering `find issueName` as the user input, the command is parsed to match `SuggestionLogicManager#parseFindCommandSuggestion`. The prefixes are then matched accordingly and a new `IssueNameSuggestion` object will be instantiated. By calling `Model#getCurrentIssueStatementSet`, `IssueNameSuggestion` is able to find the relvant issue statements based on the user input. The returned `SuggestionResult` will be passed to the `CommandBox#displaySuggestion` method to handle the displaying of the results.

One thing to take note of, the drop-down window will be hidden once a user input is matched any given suggestion value.

.IssueNameSuggestion Sequence Diagram
image::IssueNameSuggestionDiagram.png[width="800"]

// tag::suggestionDesignConsiderations[]

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect 1: Architecture Design of the Suggestion Logic subcomponent
The architecture behind the Suggestion Logic subcomponent is designed by mimicking the original `Logic` component that handles the command logic. This is because the required implementation behind both is actually similar, needing to access both the `Ui` and the `Model` components. Hence, the `SuggestionLogic` and `Suggestion` are built similar to the original Logic component which has the corresponding classes `Logic` and `Command` that serves as interfaces to the `Ui` and `Model` components respectively. However, the internal implementation of the internal classes of the Suggesetion Logic subcomponent is different (i.e. `Parser`).

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create parser methods all within `SuggestionLogicManager` that parse the user input directly - first parsing them based the commands (handled in `SuggestionLogicManager#parseUserInput`) and subsequently parsing based on the `Prefix` that the text cursor is at.

** Pros: Keeps the code DRY.

** Cons: Deviates from the original internal structure of the Command Logic subcomponent.

* **Alternative 2:** Create parser classes for each command (e.g. `EditSuggestionParser`) that handles the further parsing of the `Prefix` and creates the relevant `Suggestion` object.

** Pros: Code is more modularized since the parsing is now handled by classes.

** Cons: Code is repeated in each `SuggestionParser` class.

We use the first alternative as it best handles the issue of having duplicate logic. The internal parsing of the user inputs for suggestions differs from the Command Logic in that, Command Logic only has one level of parsing (parsing commands), whereas Suggestion Logic requires two levels (parsing commands and parsing prefixes). In order to ensure the same way of handling the same prefix in different commands (e.g. `findtag t/` and `edit 1 t/`), methods are created to do so (e.g. `SuggestionLogicManager#handleTagNameSuggestion`). This keeps the code DRY and reduces repeats logic in the code.

Further abstractions can be made to this in the future as more `Suggestion`(s) added, by moving the suggestion handlers (`SuggestionLogicManager#handleTagNameSuggestion`) into a new `Suggestion` class (instead of an interface) that the specific `XYZSuggestion`(s) inherit from.

===== Aspect 2: Deciding on how to parse the user input
We have two options to parse the user input and find the prefixes and their values.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use the existing `ArgumentTokenizer` and `ArgumentMultimap` to parse the user input

** Pros: The logic for separating the prefixes in `ArgumentTokenizer` and storing them in `ArgumentMultimap` is similar to what we need to parse our user input. By reusing the code, it prevents us from needing to rewrite code with duplicated logic elsewhere in our code base, which keeps our code DRY.

** Cons: `ArgumentTokenizer` and `ArgumentMultimap` is also used by the command logic subcomponent, by reusing this code in the suggestion logic subcomponent, it increases the coupling between the implementation of the two subcomponents which can result in new issues arising (aspects 3 and 4).

* **Alternative 2:** Parse the input by using a separate piece of code (duplicated logic from the `ArgumentTokenizer` and `ArgumentMultimap`). Slight modifications will need to be made to the duplicated logic due to differences in implementation.

** Pros: Reduces the coupling between the two command and suggestion logic subcomponents. Although the logic behind the implementation will be similar to `ArgumentTokenizer`, having it as a duplicate piece of code means that any changes will not affect and cause bugs in the other subcomponent.

** Cons: Having it duplicated logic might affect future development, especially when this duplicated logic needs to be modified, then the implementation for both pieces of code will have to be modified as well. If not documented properly, this could cause bugs if only one piece of code was modified.

===== Aspect 3: Data structure of Prefix
The original implementation of `Prefix` only stored the value of the prefix string (e.g. `/t` or `/i`), however since the implementation of the suggestion logic subcomponent uses `ArgumentMultimap`, it requires that the position of the `Prefix` in the user input string be known as well.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store an additional field `position` in `Prefix`

** Pros: Since the prefix and its location are related, this keeps all the information pertaining to the prefix encapsulated in a single class, which helps with the modularity of the code.

** Cons: The command logic subcomponent does not require the `position` field in `Prefix`, which results in it being unused. This might be confusing for future developers. This also resulted in having another aspect to consider later on (aspect 4).

* **Alternative 2:** Move the implementation and checks for the prefix position out of `Prefix`

** Pros: This does not affect the code implemented in the Command logic subcomponent, and we will have less to fix.

** Cons: Related pieces of code will be separated (i.e. since the position is stored separately, it is not properly encapsulated).

===== Aspect 4: Distinguishing each Prefix in ArgumentMultimap
The original hashcode used by `Prefix` only hashes the prefix string, as such, adding a `position` field will not make a difference since two same prefixes with different positions (e.g. `/t ... /t`) will still hash to the same key. The previous implementation handles this by having the value in the `HashMap` within `ArgumentMultimap` store a `List<String>` which will append all values with the same prefix.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Set the hashcode of `Prefix` to use both the prefix string and the position.

** Pros: The prefixes now hash differently if they have the same prefix string but different position, this allows us to have finer control needed for the Suggestion logic subcomponent when handling the prefixes in `ArgumentMultimap`.

** Cons: The Command logic subcomponent does not make use of the `position` field. As such, when attempting to extract out the values of each `Prefix` at the `Parser`, it cannot find the values as they are now hashed with the `position` as this is unknown to the `Parser` (an indirect result of the coupling due to the chosen implementation in aspect 2).

* **Alternative 2:** Use the original implementation

** Pros: Code does not affect the Command logic subcomponent, which already takes up a significant portion of the code base, hence less changes are needed.

** Cons: The code and logic are not be well encapsulated (for the `Prefix`) and we will have repeated logic in the codebase.

We eventually chose Alternative 1 as it provides a better structure and encapsulation for our code overall. We also came up with a workaround for Alternative 1's cons, by modifying the method `ArgumentMultimap#getValue`.

// end::suggestionDesignConsiderations[]

// tag::commandhighlight[]
=== Command Highlight
The command highlight feature is to differentiate command word, index, prefix and values that user input in Command Line.

==== Current Implementation
The Command Highlight mechanism uses `InlineCssTextArea` class. It uses listener to detect the change in the `commandTextArea` and check if it contains command word, parameter, index or values and assign different colors correspondingly.

==== Design Consideration
===== Aspect: Implementation of command highlight manager.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Check the character in the command box and assign different colors based on precondition.
** Pros: easy to implement by checking the prefix, index and command word.
** Cons: due to the limitation of using the character '/' as part of the prefix, it may still have some corner cases that we cannot cover.
* **Alternative 2:** Parse the user command simultaneously when user input command.
** Pros: if user inputs wrong command format, it will highlight the color correspondingly. Hence, user can correct his input immediately.
** Cons: difficult to implement.
// end::commandhighlight[]


== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation. The following sections will provide common knowledge about how to use asciidoc for documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

This section provides information related to testing, including three ways of testing, types of tests as well as troubleshooting testing.

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.saveit.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.saveit.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.saveit.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.saveit.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

This section provides a summary of useful development operations and brief information about them.

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, SaveIt depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you will not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all issues in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/logic/parser/SaveItParser.java[`SaveItParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/logic/parser/SaveItParser.java[`SaveItParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/saveit-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full email.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the SaveIt, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the SaveIt.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/model/saveit.java[`saveit`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/model/Saveit.java[`Saveit`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/model/Issue.java[`Issue`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/model/Saveit.java[`Saveit`] allows you to update an issue, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/model/Issue.java[`Issue`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/model/saveit.java[`saveit`]. Loop through each statement, and remove the `tag` from each statement.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `saveit#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/saveit-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full email.

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your SaveIt application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last statement in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside statement cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.
+
**Before**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-before.png[width="300"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/ui/IssueCard.java[the `IssueCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `IssueCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/saveit-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full email.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/SaveItSystemTest.java[`SaveItSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and SaveItSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the SaveIt is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of issues when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleSaveItChangedEvent(SaveItChangedEvent)`] to update the number of issues whenever there are new changes to the saveit.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of issues status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/SaveItSystemTest.java[`SaveItSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of issues status bar.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the SaveIt to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the SaveIt after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the SaveIt storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupSaveIt(ReadOnlySaveIt)`, so that the SaveIt can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/storage/SaveItStorage.java[`SaveItStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/storage/XmlSaveItStorage.java[`XmlSaveItStorage`] class.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `saveit`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

Edits the remark for an issue specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `edit Index r/[REMARK] s/[SOLUTION]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first statement to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first statement.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/logic/parser/SaveItParser.java[`SaveItParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/saveit/logic/parser/SaveItParserTest.java[`SaveItParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/logic/parser/SaveItParser.java[`SaveItParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/saveit/logic/parser/SaveItParserTest.java[`SaveItParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `IssueCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/ui/IssueCard.java[`IssueCard`] s to display a remark for each statement later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/ui/IssueCard.java[`IssueCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/IssueCardHandle.java[`IssueCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/model/Issue.java[`Issue`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/model/statement/Remark.java[`Remark`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Issue` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/model/Issue.java[`Issue`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/model/Issue.java[`Issue`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the statement will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `saveit.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedIssue` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Issue` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/storage/XmlAdaptedIssue.java[`XmlAdaptedIssue`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidIssueSaveIt.xml`, `typicalIssuesSaveIt.xml`, `validSaveIt.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `IssueBuilder`
Since `Issue` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/saveit/testutil/IssueBuilder.java[`IssueBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/model/Issue.java[`Issue`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/saveit/testutil/IssueBuilder.java[`IssueBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the statement that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Issue` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/saveit/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `IssueCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/ui/IssueCard.java[`IssueCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/ui/IssueCard.java[`IssueCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Issue` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/saveit/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysIssue(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of an issue.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
