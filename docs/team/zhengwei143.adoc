== Overview

This document outlines the contributions that **Tan Zheng Wei** has made to the **SaveIt** project.

**SaveIt** is targetted at programmer, and aims to help the user store and keep track of problems and solutions that they encounter. The application is meant to replace traditional use of bookmarks on browsers, and is customized especially for programmers, to make it easier for them to search for previously found solutions online. **SaveIt** is a desktop application that uses the Command Line Interface (CLI) as a mode to interact with it.

**SaveIt** is a project that is built over the course of CS2103T with a group of five members including myself.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Suggestion Logic Subcomponent
** What it does: This is a component of the codebase that allows the application to make suggestions to the user as they type.
