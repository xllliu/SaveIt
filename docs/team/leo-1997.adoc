== PROJECT: SaveIt

---

== Overview

This document is to summarize and elaborate all my contributions to the project.
Our project, SaveIt, is a issue tracker application which is morphed from AddressBook4.

SaveIt dedicates to providing a platform for storing, managing and viewing their programming related issues during daily practice for the programmers. Its main features include adding new issue and solution, managing existing issues as well as finding existing issues. It is especially designed for the user who prefers command line interface (CLI) as all the commands require command line input. It also preserves the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) at the same time. If you can type fast, SaveIt can help you search the same issue that save previously faster than traditional GUI apps.

The project is implemented for applying and showing the learning outcomes of CS2103T, and it is done by a group of five CS2103T students including myself.

== Summary of contributions
This section is to summarize and explain my contributions towards this project.

* *Major enhancement*: add the *solution filed to model structure along with enable adding solution or issue*
** What it does: It constitutes the basic model structure by adding new issue and new solution into SaveIt. This allows all the following features to be carried out in SaveIt.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as a user can now add more issues and solutions to the application. This is the most important and fundamental function our application aims to achieve.
** Highlights: This enhancement involves not only model component but also GUI, storage components in the application and it requires a lot of effort to build it properly. The add command on the other hand needs to handle different requests in different directories.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Implement basic autosuggestion feature for find and findByTag command. https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T12-4/main/pull/107[#107]
** Refactor autosuggestion component. https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T12-4/main/pull/168[#168]
** Add retrieve command to copy the solution link to system clipboard. https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T12-4/main/pull/85[#85]
** Refactor the application from AddressBook Level 4 to SaveIt. https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T12-4/main/pull/4[#4] https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T12-4/main/pull/56[#56] https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T12-4/main/pull/68[#68]
