= PROJECT: SaveIt

---

== Overview

This project portfolio is intended to document my contributions to the development of SaveIt App.

*SaveIt* is an issue tracker application targeting programmers. It provides a platform for storing, managing and viewing their programming related issues during daily practices. It was developed as part of the module requirements for CS2103T (Software Engineering).

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Enhance *the ability to edit `issue`, `solution` and `tag`*.

*** What it does: This feature allows a user to edit any fields in an issue and solution. Also it improves flexibility to edit tags. (Relevant commands: `edit`, `addtag` and `refactortag`)
*** Justification: This feature improves this application significantly, by reducing the amount of time needed to edit existing entries, instead of deleting the issue and adding a new issue.
*** Highlights: This feature allows users to edit issue and solution easily. Also, they can add tags by range of indexes and change tags for all issue entries easily. It requires a depth analysis of different conditions to judge if the command is valid.

* *Minor enhancements*:
** Implement `command highlight` feature: Allows users to differentiate their inputs by highlighting command word, index, parameters and values in different colors.
** Implement `command alias` feature: Allows users to type less command words but achieve the same functionality.
** Morph the application from AddressBook Level 4 to SaveIt app. https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T12-4/main/issues/30[#30], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T12-4/main/pull/44[#44]
